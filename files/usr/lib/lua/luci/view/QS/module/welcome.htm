<p>Congratulations! You have a Commotion node and are ready to join a network or start a new one. This wizard will guide you through the setup. The setup process should take about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>You can still change settings after setup is complete. </p>

<p>First, the wizard will scan to see if there are any existing mesh networks in your area.</p>
