<p>If after a minute or two you still have no neighbors it could be because you are using a custom configuration that does not allow your node to connect to its neighbors, your node is in a location that is not being reached by neighboring nodes like a basement, behind a wall, or in dense foliage, or you just may not be near any other nodes. If you would like to keep this configuration please click 'Finish', else, click 'Start Over' to begin again.",</p>
